<p style="font-size:18px;margin:10px 0;">Founded in 2007 by Daniel Playfair Cal, FSHS Robotics is a student run club dedicated to experiencing the rapidly evolving fields of mechanical, software and electrical engineering with the goal of winning trophies at the RoboCup Junior Australia competition.</p>
<p style="font-size:14px;margin:10px 0;">We primarily compete in two divisions: Rescue, where robots navigate an obstacle course to locate and rescue a victim, and Soccer, where teams face off with two robots each to score the most goals possible.</p>
<p style="font-size:14px;margin:10px 0;">Over the years, the club started off with just one team of 2-3 students growing to the 10 teams we entered this year at the state competition, being the second largest extra-curricular activity Fort Street offers.</p>
