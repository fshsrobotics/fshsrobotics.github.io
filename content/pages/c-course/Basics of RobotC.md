## 2.1 RobotC Introduction
Now that we've learnt a tiny bit of C, let's quickly look at RobotC. Everything in [the table](/c-course/basics-of-c/#12-hello-world) from 1.2 is the same, except:

| Code | RobotC Code | Comment |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `#include <stdio.h>` | - | Not needed! Instead, some automatically generated code replaces this. |
| `int main() { ... }` | `task main() { ... }` | Instead of returning an int, we call them 'tasks'. |
| `return 0` | - | Tasks do not require return values. |

## 2.2 Moving motors in RobotC
Let's look at a program that runs Motor A for one second, then stops. 

```c
#pragma config(Motor, motorA, motorL, tmotorNXT, PIDControl, encoder)
//*!!Code automatically generated by 'ROBOTC' configuration wizard !!*//

task main() {
    motor[motorL] = 100; // SETS the motor speed
    wait1Msec(1000); // Keeps running at 100 speed for 1 second
    motor[motorL] = 0; // sets speed to 0
}
```

Key things to note:

* C reads top to bottom. So, the motor is set to 100, nothing happens for 1 second, then it stops.
* The `=` **makes a change** to a particular variable. Here, it's changing the motor speed variable.
* The `1000` in `wait1Msec(1000)` is an **argument** to the wait function. We can change this number if we want it to be longer or shorter.
* The **motor speed is set**. It isn't '**pinged**' - from the point you call `motor[motorL] = 100`, it will run at 100 speed forever until it is stopped or the program terminates.

## 2.3 Exercises
Given the following starting code, copy the code into a new file, call it `simplemotor.c` and save it in your Robotics folder.

```c
#pragma config(Motor, motorA, motorL, tmotorNXT, PIDControl, encoder)
#pragma config(Motor, motorB, motorR, tmotorNXT, PIDControl, encoder)
//*!!Code automatically generated by 'ROBOTC' configuration wizard !!*//

task main() {
    motor[motorL] = 30;  // SETS the left motor speed
    motor[motorR] = -30; // SETS the right motor speed to go backwards
    wait1Msec(1000);     // Keeps running for 1 second
    motor[motorL] = 0;   // sets speed to 0
    motor[motorR] = 0;   // sets speed to 0
}
```

1. What do you think the code does? If it was hooked to a robot with two wheels, what would the robot do?
2. Change the code so that the robot goes forward for 1 second, spin clockwise for 3 seconds, moves backwards for 1 second and then stops.

Ask for the code to be uploaded to a demo robot and see if it works!
