A quick guide to getting started in C.

# What is VSCode?!
This year we are using VSCode (Visual Studio Code) as our editor. This is for the **C code** section of our lessons, RobotC uses a separate editor and you must use the correct editor to compile.

VSCode is awesome because while it's primarily an editor, you can also:
* Use TCC, our compiler, to run C code
* Have syntax highlighting and automatic indents, so that your code is super clean
* Open RobotC files for viewing (not running) - and reindent lines
* It works on Linux, Windows and Mac
