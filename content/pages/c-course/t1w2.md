## Today

- Get a list of students and teams, and what competition each team is competing in

then...

- **Juniors** (people who have not competed): start playing around with our demo robots! 
  - Check out the website - Resources > C Course > 6. Sensors and Motors
  - Check out the project, which we will build up our coding skills to be able to complete
  - Work on your own, ask questions
- **Seniors**: sorry, we can't distribute kits yet
  - Xavier still has some barcoding
  - With your team, type up some notes on the following:
    1. Write a simple short plan for your work this year
      - What specific parameters do you need? e.g. motors, sensors, numbers
      - What do you need to change from experience? e.g. movement, sensor positioning
      - What is needed from coding? e.g. proportional/PID, green square, spill exit
      - What are general dates and milestones you want to achieve? e.g. simple bot constructed by Week 5 Term 1
    2. Send your plan to me via email by 4:30pm
