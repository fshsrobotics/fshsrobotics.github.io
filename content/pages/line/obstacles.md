## Obstacles
There are a few tile-based obstacles:

* **Water tower**, a large bottle, or three smaller bottles, that you must navigate around.
* **Speed bumps**, three sets of bumps raised up to 10mm from the ground. 
* **See saw**, falls once your robot is beyond halfway across the tile.
* Other obstacles may be pushed around but your robot shouldn't lose the line for more than 300mm. 

## Ramps

* **Ramps** are tiles at different levels, inclined up to 17.5 degrees. 
* **Tunnels** are tiles that are above other tiles.
* **Doorways** is an orange U shape at any straight location along the line. Your robot must fit between the 270 x 270mm doorway for Open Rescue (180 x 180mm for Secondary).

## Tips
* Make sure you build your robot to be able to handle the different conditions they will face. Many robots get light sensors or back wheels stuck on bumps, or do not have enough traction to drive and follow a curving line up a slope. 
* Code your colour sensors to be able to have some variation in the lighting. The lighting in the competition space may also be different from the classroom, so make sure this can be tweaked and recalibrated on the day too!
