## Tips for Line Follow
* Wrap your colour sensors with paper that nearly touches the ground.
* Make sure your wheels are relatively **close to and behind** your colour sensors. 
    * Making the wheels really wide will make your robot turn more suddenly - which is not something you want.
    * Having your colour sensors too far from the wheels will mean your robot reacts too fast.
    * Having your colour sensors after the wheels means you react too late.
* Keep your **colour sensors as close** as you can, and consistent as you can.
    * This makes your movements less erratic.
    * The colour sensors should float on top, independent of the robot chassis. If the sensors can slide up and down, you will have generally consistent readings.

## Tips for Obstacles
* Detecting the water tower using a **touch sensor** is more reliable - if there is space, use a touch sensor.
* Make sure your robot does not get stuck on ramps, speed bumps or seesaws. Whenever you change your robot, check that it works on these tricky tiles.
    * Make sure your centre of gravity for the robot is over your driving wheels when climbing up and down slopes.

## Tips for Spill
* Your sonar needs to be low enough to detect cans and the final platform. Or, if you can find space for a camera and coders are up to the challenge, you can use a Pixy or NXTCam to detect coloured objects. 
* If you run out of sensor connections, you can use a sensor splitter, but this may take some more time to get working.
* **Pickup mechanism tips**
    * There are many ways to do it, take a look at [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRDsN7mSMNDprkxp-qq-WL6D2TtYLx4Pm) for some ideas, as well as our sample logbooks.
