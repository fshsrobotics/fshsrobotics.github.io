## Chemical Spill
* At the end of the course, there is a chemical spill. There is a silver strip at the start of the spill
* For Open Rescue, you need to:
    * Control a silver (aluminium wrapped) can in the spill. Control means that the can moves along with the robot in all directions
    * Pick up and drop the can on an orange evacuation platform, upright
    * Continue to pick up any other silver cans in the spill
* There may be black duct tape wrapped cans in the spill, which do not need to be rescued.
* After rescuing all cans, the robot must leave from the silver strip it entered from.

## Tips
* Design a pick up mechanism that is reliable. You will spend a lot of time testing, rebuilding and testing.
* Start early - the chemical spill is the part that takes the longest for most students.
* Make sure that it can detect the silver strip when it comes straight from a ramp - often the sensors are not low enough to detect the silver strip properly. See the spill [at the top of this page](/line/tiles/).

* The chemical spill can have different sizes, and the orange evacuation platform can be repositioned to different locations. Start small and practice on the normal tile, but make sure you try and make it work for larger or smaller spills as well. 
    * Note that some photos may be missing the orange evacuation platform - that is because Primary and Secondary Rescue only need to drag the can out.
