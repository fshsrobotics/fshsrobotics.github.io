<h1>Week 5: Lab: printf, scanf, if</h1>
<div style="border:4px solid #4060fa; padding:20px;line-height:180%">
<p>Hey all! I'm sitting an exam right now, so do these problems.</p>
<div style="background:#f6f8ff;margin:10px -20px;padding:10px 20px;">
<p>You should learn the The <b>Feynman Problem-Solving Algorithm</b>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write down the problem</li>
<li>think very hard, and</li>
<li>write down the answer.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>More importantly, there should be seniors around that can help you out - <b>ask them for help, introduce yourselves</b>! I promise they don't bite. If you're super stuck, there's two places to look:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="Week+4#chickens" rel="nofollow">Week 4 code</a> - all the chicken stuff with printf, scanf and if</li>
<li><a href="file/view/2%20Variables.pdf" rel="nofollow">2. Variables</a> - part of a booklet I'm writing that has some of the content on <b>printf and variables</b>.</li>
<li><a href="/Week+2" rel="nofollow">Week 2 from the 2016 Course</a> - this page has other snippets of code and some more detailed explanation of <b>scanf and if</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Good luck with the problems!</p>

<h2>1. Print out a chicken: <a href="file/view/w6q1.c" rel="nofollow">Solutions</a></h2>
<p>Create a file <code>bird.c</code> that prints a bird on the screen when run. You should be able to write this program using some printf statements and using new lines (<code>\n</code>).</p>
<p>Sample:</p>
<pre class="rds-code">
  ___
 ('v')
((___))
 ^   ^
</pre>
<h2>2.1 Ask for an age</h2>
<ul>
<li>Create a file <code>age.c</code></li>
<li>User is asked to enter an age.</li>
<li>Once the user hits enter, it should print out "You are __ years old!"</li>
<li>Make sure it is exactly the same that is printed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sample 1</p>
<pre class="rds-code">
Enter an age: 64
You are 64 years old!
</pre>
<h2>2.2 Teen-age: <a href="file/view/w6q2.c" rel="nofollow">Solutions</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Create a file <code>teenage.c</code>, or continue using <code>age.c</code>.</li>
<li>User is asked to enter an age.</li>
<li>Once the user hits enter, it should print out "You are __ years old!"</li>
<li>If the age is between 13 and 19 inclusive, it should also print out "You're also a teen."</li>
</ul>
<p>Sample 1</p>
<pre class="rds-code">
Enter an age: 64
You are 64 years old!
</pre>
<p>Sample 2</p>
<pre class="rds-code">
Enter an age: 15
You are 15 years old!
You're also a teen.
</pre>
<h2>3. Name of Month: <a href="file/view/w6q3.c" rel="nofollow">Solutions</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Create a file <code>months.c</code></li>
</ul>
Ask for a month number and return the name of the month.
<p>Sample 1</p>
<pre class="rds-code">
Enter a month: 5
May
</pre>
<p>Sample 2</p>
<pre class="rds-code">
Enter a month: 12
December
</pre>
<p>Sample 3</p>
<pre class="rds-code">
Enter a month: 16
Not a valid month
</pre>
<h2>4. Bad Code: <a href="file/view/w6q4.c" rel="nofollow">Solutions</a></h2>
<p>Uh oh! We gave Mr Semaan the task to write some C code. Unfortunately, it's a bit wrong. It's meant to ask you to put in his favourite number, and print out if it is right or not.</p>
<p>Your task is to fix up his program so that it is <b>indented properly</b>, <b>compiles with no errors</b> and it <b>returns the correct results</b>.</p>
<pre class="rds-code">
<code class="cpp">
#include stdio.h&gt;
int main() {
    printf("Guess my favourite number: ");
        scanf("%d", n);
            int faveNumber;
if (faveNumber = 17) {
printf("You're right!\n");
} 
else {
printf("You're wrong.\n");
}
    return 0;
}</code>
</pre>
<h2 id="challenge">5. Challenge: Tic Tac Toe: <a href="file/view/w6q5.c" rel="nofollow">Solutions</a></h2>
<p>Write a program <code>tictactoe.c</code> that takes in a tic tac toe board and determines who wins in that game. Player 1 is represented by '1', Player 2 is represented by '2', and empty cells are represented by '0's.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your program should take in nine integers, three per line separated by spaces (so, three rows, each row has three integers separated by spaces)</li>
<li><b>Tip</b>: to get three integers instead of one, you can scanf 3 integers: <code>scanf("%d %d %d", &amp;cell1, &amp;cell2, &amp;cell3);</code></li>
<li>Your program should print out who wins, or if no one has won</li>
</ul>
<p>Sample 1</p>
<pre class="rds-code">
1 2 1
1 1 2
2 2 1
Player 1 has won!
</pre>
<p>Sample 2</p>
<pre class="rds-code">
0 0 1
1 1 0
2 2 2
Player 2 has won!
</pre>
<p>Sample 3</p>
<pre class="rds-code">
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 2
No players have won.
