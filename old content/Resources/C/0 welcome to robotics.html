<h2 id="preface">0.1 Preface</h2>
<p>Hello and welcome to FSHS Robotics! We are happy for you to join our family.</p>
<p>We are a student run club dedicated to experiencing the rapidly evolving fields of mechanical, software and electrical engineering.</p>
<p>This is our textbook for learning C and RobotC. Feel free to go through these chapters at your own pace – what matters is you learn and try out all sorts of problems that you are interested in. Be self-directed and be motivated!</p>
<p>If you spot any errors, shoot an email to fshsrobotics@gmail.com.</p>
<h2 id="learn-and-think">0.2 Learn and Think</h2>
<p>Robotics is all about thinking and solving problems, and programming is one magical and interactive way of learning how to design, develop and produce great solutions. So, we’ll not only teach you how to program and build a robot, but this program will also teach you how to work independently and as a part of a team. You’ll find that this group will become your second home – your team members will be those who will help you troubleshoot and fix all the pesky bugs and hardware problems you will inevitably stumble on.</p>
<p>Robotics is also a really new field – you’ll hear in the news all sorts of new robots, automated machines and search and rescue automation. You’ll feel you are actually making something and at the end of the year, you’ll feel accomplished and it’ll further your knowledge in whatever field you’ll be interested in in the future.</p>
<p>Hopefully you’ll get more than just the fundamentals in programming – go outside your boundaries and try out all sorts of things, think of all sorts of solutions! Be smart and ask questions.</p>
